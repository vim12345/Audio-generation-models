# Audio-generation-models
# Description:
Audio generation models are a class of generative models that produce audio data, such as speech, music, or sound effects. These models can generate high-quality audio by learning from existing audio data and capturing the underlying patterns in sound. Techniques like WaveNet and GANs have been widely used for audio generation tasks.

In this project, we’ll implement a simple audio generation model to generate audio samples based on input data, such as music or speech.


# ✅ What It Does:
* Defines a simple WaveNet-inspired model for generating audio by using 1D convolutional layers to process the audio data sequentially

* The model generates an audio sample from the input audio by learning patterns over time

* Uses MSE loss to train the model to generate audio similar to the input audio

* Plots the generated audio waveform every few epochs to visualize the results
